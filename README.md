PostgreSQL language server
==========================

This project provides a language server implementation (https://langserver.org) for PostgreSQL projects.
It is currently in development, but targets the following features:
- code completion,
- diagnostics (missing tables/columns, invalid joins),
- automatic query refactoring (extract to sub-query, inline sub-query...)

This is an early draft, more work will be published here in the next months.

You are very welcome to try this out, find and fix bugs, submit PRs...
